# Temporal Dynamics of Gene Expression in Parkinson's Disease

## 1, Results

### On IRIS HPC

- Install required R packages into your user library (`~/Rlibs`):

```bash
module load env/release/2023b
module load lang/R-bundle-CRAN/2024.06-foss-2023b
Rscript install_packages.R
```

- Run the main analysis via SLURM in an interactive session:
```bash
sbatch RunAnalysis.slurm
```
**RunAnalysis.slurm** loads the same R module and runs scRNAseq_Analysis.R on SeuratFinal.rds.

## 2, Appendix

All appendix plots were generated by running **transcriptomics_analysis.qmd** locally on the system.
